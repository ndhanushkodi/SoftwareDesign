When I used gene_finder on the Salmonella Enterica dna with a threshold of 
600, I got an output of 7 genes in the form of amino acids.

I put a few of these genes into protein-BLAST, and these are the proteins they
coded for:
    
    ATP synthase SpaL [Salmonella enterica]
    antigen presentation protein SpaN [Salmonella enterica]
    type III secretion system protein SpaP [Salmonella enterica]
    type III secretion system protein SpaR [Salmonella enterica]
    surface presentation of antigens protein SpaO [Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. LT2]
